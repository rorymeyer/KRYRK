## Kami 

## Hello!

My name is Kami Ziolkowski and I am a graduate student in the Business Analytics program at the Ross School of Business. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Data Science and a minor in Polish.

In my free time I like to *dance*, bake, and work on my bullet journal. I'm interested in music, coding, and learning really random facts.

A few fun facts about myself:

1. I sneeze when I step into the sun
2. I have been to 30 of the 50 states
3. I have two cats named **Rue** and **Mr. Man**
4. My favorite color is burgundy
