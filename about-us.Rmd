## Kami 

Hello! My name is Kami Ziolkowski and I am a graduate student in the Business Analytics program at the Ross School of Business. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Data Science and a minor in Polish.

In my free time I like to *dance*, bake, and work on my bullet journal. I'm interested in music, coding, and learning really random facts.

A few fun facts about myself:

1. I sneeze when I step into the sun
2. I have been to 30 of the 50 states
3. I have two cats named **Rue** and **Mr. Man**
4. My favorite color is burgundy

Hi! My name is Aurora Meyer, but I prefer to go by Rory. I am a graduate student at the Ross School of Business pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics. This past April, I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Michigan. I also completed a minor in Computer Science. During my time at Michigan thus far, I learned how to code (the basics) in MATLAB, C++, Python, and HTML + JavaScript. So, I am excited to add R to my list of languages this summer!

I am from Washington D.C. I have 3 older siblings (2 sisters and a brother), a dog named Belle, and a cat named Daisy. After college, I would love to move back to the east coast, but I'm not quite sure where yet. I am also considering moving abroad, likely somewhere in Europe, for a few years since I never had the opportunity to study abroad during undergrad.

Some fun facts about me:

- Italian is my favorite cuisine.
- My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough.
- I love to go skiing in Colorado in the winter.
- I prefer a lake vacation over a beach vacation.
- I want to visit Australia one day.

## Kian

# Kian Tabatabai

## Background
My name is *Kian Tabatabai*. Yes, a persian name, but not quite 100% persian genes. My mom and dad were both immigrants from Taiwan and Iran, respectively. A look at my face can foster ambiguity about my ethnic background. My ethnic background played a large role in my upbringing in an otherwise small, conservative town. I grew up in York, PA which is about 45 minutes South of Harrisburg, PA. Throughout my life, I was heavily involved in high school extracurricular activities such as highschool soccer and the Math Club. This is where I also found my passions for **business and finance**. 

## Education
I graduated from the *University of Pittsburgh* in 2021 with a business degree in **Finance**. There, I participated in a research lab as a data analyst which led me to find my passion for data science! I also participated in a student run club called *Panther Equity*. In our weekly meetings, we would work in teams to deliver stock pitches to the entire organization with the possibility of adding to our student-managed portfolio. Currently, I am an MBAn student at the *Ross School of Business* with an expected graduation date of April 2023. Here, I plan to cultivate my knowledge in both finance and technology!

## Interests
Some of my interests outside of the classroom include **fitness**, **investing**, **videogames**, and **performance cars**. I am a regular gym goer that enjoys to meet others and learn about their fitness goals and journey. I found my passion for fitness around the same time I learned about trading on the stock market (about 17 years old). Since I executed my first trade, I have never stopped reading market news and doing my own research on trading strategies! Finally, in my moments of extra free time, I enjoy playing videogames with my friends online and read about the latest breakthroughs in the performance vehicles industry!
