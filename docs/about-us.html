<p>Hello! My name is Kami Ziolkowski and I am a graduate student in the Business Analytics program at the Ross School of Business. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Data Science and a minor in Polish.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="me2.jpg" style="width:50.0%"></div>
<p>In my free time I like to <em>dance</em>, bake, and work on my bullet journal. I’m interested in music, coding, and learning really random facts.</p>
<p>A few fun facts about myself:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I sneeze when I step into the sun</li>
<li>I have been to 30 of the 50 states</li>
<li>I have two cats named <strong>Rue</strong> and <strong>Mr. Man</strong>
</li>
<li>My favorite color is burgundy</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Rajat Kadian and it is nice to meet you on this page! I am from Sonipat, India which is ~ 20 minutes drive from the capital of Delhi. Fun fact, the name <em>Rajat</em> is a hindi word which means silver - the metal. My grandmother picked this name for me and, surprisingly, it encapsulates my personality. Silver is a precious metal and besides ornamental value, it displays a variety of uses. It is a demanding metal and if not placed in the right environment it is quite vulnerable to corrosion/decay. Same goes for me, I am a resourceful and driven individual but a non-conducive environment prevents me to shine at what I do. Currently, I am a student at the Ross School of Business <em>(Go Blue!)</em> pursuing a graduate degree in Business Analytics. Here I am learning skills primed at the nexus of the business and technology sector. As one of my professors here, Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, said once <strong>“Leadership is fleeting, skills are forever,”</strong> I am honing my skills in this accelerated, competitive program to contribute to the Digital Age and the Age of Innovation. Previously, I have completed my undergraduate studies from Purdue University <em>(Boiler Up!)</em> in Economics and Finance. As an individual, I love adventurous activities! Hiking, biking, kayaking etc. give me my child-like energy and enthusiasm. If you have a great camping suggestion or bungee jumping challenge, I will be the one calling dibs. Recently, I have crossed <em>skydiving</em> off of my bucket list when I did a fall from 13,500 feet in Indianapolis. I thought it was too low and maybe I can go higher next time! Next on my list is <em>scuba diving</em> to discover the aquatic wonders of this world and have a get a new perspective of this beautiful planet. If you know any good places to scuba dive, don’t be a stranger and reach out!</p>
<p><strong>Let me leave you with a 2-Truths-and-a-Lie question.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I can speak Italian.</li>
<li>I am a single child.</li>
<li>I have addressed a crowd of 10,000+ people.</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p>Background</p>
<p>My name is Yuqi Shi. I was born and raised in Qingdao, a coastal city in Eastern China, and I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Supply Chain Management &amp; Technology and Operations Management from the University of Wisconsin - Madison (Go Badgers!). Hoping to be a maritime logistic analyst, I’m pursuing my master’s degree in Business Analytics at the University of Michigan, Ross School of Business (Go Blue!).</p>
<p>My hometown has the seventh largest commercial port in the world. When I was a kid, I used to sit by the dock, watching the sparkling water imprints left by hundreds of container ships in the setting sun, and forget about time. I hope that one day, with my knowledge and ability, I can contribute to constructing a more efficient and advanced Qingdao Port.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>I love travelling. My friends always joke that I should consider majoring in tourism management. I enjoy “measuring the world” as Alexander Humboldt says and seeing the wonders of the road. I once drove to the depths of the Mongolian prairie, and from Sichuan Province across the Tibetan Plateau to the roof of the world - Mount Everest (although only to the base camp).</p>
<p>In the three years since I came to the US, I have left my footprints in 45 states, exploring glaciers in the Arctic Circle in Alaska and appreciating the fireworks in front of Cinderella Castle in Florida. If you are also a traveler, please get in touch with me, let’s share what we’ve seen, and plan our next journey :)</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Aurora Meyer, but I prefer to go by Rory. I am a graduate student at the Ross School of Business pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics. This past April, I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Michigan. I also completed a minor in Computer Science. During my time at Michigan thus far, I learned how to code (the basics) in MATLAB, C++, Python, and HTML + JavaScript. So, I am excited to add R to my list of languages this summer!</p>
<p>I am from Washington D.C. I have 3 older siblings (2 sisters and a brother), a dog named Belle, and a cat named Daisy. After college, I would love to move back to the east coast, but I’m not quite sure where yet. I am also considering moving abroad, likely somewhere in Europe, for a few years since I never had the opportunity to study abroad during undergrad.</p>
<p>Some fun facts about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian is my favorite cuisine.</li>
<li>My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough.</li>
<li>I love to go skiing in Colorado in the winter.</li>
<li>I prefer a lake vacation over a beach vacation.</li>
<li>I want to visit Australia one day.</li>
</ul>

<span class="header-section-number">0.5</span> Kian Tabatabai<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#kian-tabatabai"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>My name is <em>Kian Tabatabai</em>. Yes, a persian name, but not quite 100% persian genes. My mom and dad were both immigrants from Taiwan and Iran, respectively. A look at my face can foster ambiguity about my ethnic background. My ethnic background played a large role in my upbringing in an otherwise small, conservative town. I grew up in York, PA which is about 45 minutes South of Harrisburg, PA. Throughout my life, I was heavily involved in high school extracurricular activities such as highschool soccer and the Math Club. This is where I also found my passions for <strong>business and finance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>I graduated from the <em>University of Pittsburgh</em> in 2021 with a business degree in <strong>Finance</strong>. There, I participated in a research lab as a data analyst which led me to find my passion for data science! I also participated in a student run club called <em>Panther Equity</em>. In our weekly meetings, we would work in teams to deliver stock pitches to the entire organization with the possibility of adding to our student-managed portfolio. Currently, I am an MBAn student at the <em>Ross School of Business</em> with an expected graduation date of April 2023. Here, I plan to cultivate my knowledge in both finance and technology!</p>
<p><strong>Interests</strong></p>
<p>Some of my interests outside of the classroom include <strong>fitness</strong>, <strong>investing</strong>, <strong>videogames</strong>, and <strong>performance cars</strong>. I am a regular gym goer that enjoys to meet others and learn about their fitness goals and journey. I found my passion for fitness around the same time I learned about trading on the stock market (about 17 years old). Since I executed my first trade, I have never stopped reading market news and doing my own research on trading strategies! Finally, in my moments of extra free time, I enjoy playing videogames with my friends online and read about the latest breakthroughs in the performance vehicles industry!</p>
