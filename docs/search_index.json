[["index.html", "How to Make the Most Out of Your Summer in Ann Arbor Introduction to the Guide", " How to Make the Most Out of Your Summer in Ann Arbor KRYRK 2022-08-02 Introduction to the Guide As the MBAn program starts at the end of June, we feel that it is important for students to have a comprehensive guide on how to make the most out of their summer in Ann Arbor as they kick-start their Michigan experience. Everyone is coming from a different place, whether it be from the same state, the same country, or a completely different country. The summer is a time to transition to the recruiting season, so our goal is to make sure that students feel settled, at home, and make friends who will be there for them for the program’s length and hopefully beyond. While school is the primary focus of our time here, it is vital to students’ mental health that they are able to enjoy their free time outside of class and easily navigate their environment. So, we want to give students an easy-access guide to the different facets of life in Ann Arbor. In this project, we will create chapters that we feel are the main aspects of transitioning to Ann Arbor. We want to make it easier for future MBAn students to succeed in their program while having lots of fun. The first chapter is dedicated to introducing the authors of the project as well as introducing the purpose of the report. The remainder of the chapters include information about Move-In, Academics, Shopping, Food/Entertainment, and Commuting.

My name is Kami Ziolkowski and I am a graduate student in the Business Analytics program at the Ross School of Business. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Data Science and a minor in Polish. In my free time I like to dance, bake, and work on my bullet journal. I’m interested in music, coding, and learning really random facts. A few fun facts about myself: I sneeze when I step into the sun I have been to 30 of the 50 states I have two cats named Rue and Mr. Man My favorite color is burgundy 0.2 Rajat Kadian Hello, I am Rajat Kadian and it is nice to meet you on this page! I am from Sonipat, India which is ~ 20 minutes drive from the capital of Delhi. Fun fact, the name Rajat is a hindi word which means silver - the metal. My grandmother picked this name for me and, surprisingly, it encapsulates my personality. Silver is a precious metal and besides ornamental value, it displays a variety of uses. It is a demanding metal and if not placed in the right environment it is quite vulnerable to corrosion/decay. Same goes for me, I am a resourceful and driven individual but a non-conducive environment prevents me to shine at what I do. Currently, I am a student at the Ross School of Business (Go Blue!) pursuing a graduate degree in Business Analytics. Here I am learning skills primed at the nexus of the business and technology sector. As one of my professors here, Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, said once “Leadership is fleeting, skills are forever,” I am honing my skills in this accelerated, competitive program to contribute to the Digital Age and the Age of Innovation. Previously, I have completed my undergraduate studies from Purdue University (Boiler Up!) in Economics and Finance. As an individual, I love adventurous activities! Hiking, biking, kayaking etc. give me my child-like energy and enthusiasm. If you have a great camping suggestion or bungee jumping challenge, I will be the one calling dibs. Recently, I have crossed skydiving off of my bucket list when I did a fall from 13,500 feet in Indianapolis. I thought it was too low and maybe I can go higher next time! Next on my list is scuba diving to discover the aquatic wonders of this world and have a get a new perspective of this beautiful planet. If you know any good places to scuba dive, don’t be a stranger and reach out! Let me leave you with a 2-Truths-and-a-Lie question. I can speak Italian. I am a single child. I have addressed a crowd of 10,000+ people. Favorite Lines Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. Let’s connect rkadian@umich.edu | 765-701-9099 Check out my LinkedIn! 0.3 Yuqi Shi Background My name is Yuqi Shi. I was born and raised in Qingdao, a coastal city in Eastern China, and I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Supply Chain Management &amp; Technology and Operations Management from the University of Wisconsin - Madison (Go Badgers!). Hoping to be a maritime logistic analyst, I’m pursuing my master’s degree in Business Analytics at the University of Michigan, Ross School of Business (Go Blue!). My hometown has the seventh largest commercial port in the world. When I was a kid, I used to sit by the dock, watching the sparkling water imprints left by hundreds of container ships in the setting sun, and forget about time. I hope that one day, with my knowledge and ability, I can contribute to constructing a more efficient and advanced Qingdao Port. Other I love travelling. My friends always joke that I should consider majoring in tourism management. I enjoy “measuring the world” as Alexander Humboldt says and seeing the wonders of the road. I once drove to the depths of the Mongolian prairie, and from Sichuan Province across the Tibetan Plateau to the roof of the world - Mount Everest (although only to the base camp). In the three years since I came to the US, I have left my footprints in 45 states, exploring glaciers in the Arctic Circle in Alaska and appreciating the fireworks in front of Cinderella Castle in Florida. If you are also a traveler, please get in touch with me, let’s share what we’ve seen, and plan our next journey :) 0.4 Rory Meyer Hi! My name is Aurora Meyer, but I prefer to go by Rory. I am a graduate student at the Ross School of Business pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics. This past April, I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Michigan. I also completed a minor in Computer Science. During my time at Michigan thus far, I learned how to code (the basics) in MATLAB, C++, Python, and HTML + JavaScript. So, I am excited to add R to my list of languages this summer! I am from Washington D.C. I have 3 older siblings (2 sisters and a brother), a dog named Belle, and a cat named Daisy. After college, I would love to move back to the east coast, but I’m not quite sure where yet. I am also considering moving abroad, likely somewhere in Europe, for a few years since I never had the opportunity to study abroad during undergrad. Some fun facts about me: Italian is my favorite cuisine. My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough. I love to go skiing in Colorado in the winter. I prefer a lake vacation over a beach vacation. I want to visit Australia one day. 0.5 Kian Tabatabai Background My name is Kian Tabatabai. Yes, a persian name, but not quite 100% persian genes. My mom and dad were both immigrants from Taiwan and Iran, respectively. A look at my face can foster ambiguity about my ethnic background. My ethnic background played a large role in my upbringing in an otherwise small, conservative town. I grew up in York, PA which is about 45 minutes South of Harrisburg, PA. Throughout my life, I was heavily involved in high school extracurricular activities such as highschool soccer and the Math Club. This is where I also found my passions for business and finance. Education I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2021 with a business degree in Finance. There, I participated in a research lab as a data analyst which led me to find my passion for data science! I also participated in a student run club called Panther Equity. In our weekly meetings, we would work in teams to deliver stock pitches to the entire organization with the possibility of adding to our student-managed portfolio. Currently, I am an MBAn student at the Ross School of Business with an expected graduation date of April 2023. Here, I plan to cultivate my knowledge in both finance and technology! Interests Some of my interests outside of the classroom include fitness, investing, videogames, and performance cars. I am a regular gym goer that enjoys to meet others and learn about their fitness goals and journey. I found my passion for fitness around the same time I learned about trading on the stock market (about 17 years old). Since I executed my first trade, I have never stopped reading market news and doing my own research on trading strategies! Finally, in my moments of extra free time, I enjoy playing videogames with my friends online and read about the latest breakthroughs in the performance vehicles industry!

It is strongly recommended that everyone sublet through the official channels of the apartment.

Online reservation in advance is USD 12 per person for one-way, two pieces of luggage can be carried for free, and extra baggage will be charged at USD 15. (Insert Picture Here) You can also go directly to the station at the appointed time. The one-way fee is 15 US dollars. You need to prepare for the change in advance. The driver will not accept banknotes above 20 US dollars. Michigan Flyer operates 12-13 daily shuttles between Detroit Airport - DTW and Ann Arbor, about an hour, with parking at: Blake Transit Center (near Middle Campus) Kensington Detroit Airport East Lansing When booking tickets online, select the pickup and drop-off location, the ride time, the airline, and the number of passengers. Detroit Airport has several stops. Delta (Delta Air Lines), Air France, and KLM are in the new terminal. When stopping, pay attention to the radio on the car or ask the driver to avoid taking the wrong terminal. Opening hours: DTW Evans Terminal: 7:15AM - 8:15PM DTW McNamara Terminal: 7:30AM - 8:30PM *Note that itineraries change from time to time due to weather, traffic, or other conditions. In this case, Michigan Flyer may reverse the order of pickup and drop-off at both DTW terminals. So, the time may be adjusted accordingly. For details, please check the official website. Choosing a bus two hours after the flight arrives is recommended, leaving enough time for yourself. If you accidentally miss your ride, please bring your ticket reservation voucher and board the next train. However, it should be noted that in this way, it is necessary to wait for other passengers who have booked this trip to get on the bus and ensure that there are still empty seats in the car before getting on the bus. 2.4.2 Ride Share - Uber / Lyft If you have fellow students carpooling together, you can choose these two very convenient car-hailing software. The cost from the airport to the campus is about 40-70 US dollars. (After 9:00 p.m., it takes about 20 minutes to wait because there are fewer cars, but the price is much lower, and you can get it for 25-40 US dollars, depending on whether it is a peak period or not) 2.4.3 AirRide https://www.theride.org/Services/Airport-Service (Insert Picture Here) Beginning July 13, 2018, AirRide’s pickup location for all passengers at the McNamara Terminal at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) has been moved to a more convenient location on the Departures Level, near Air France and Aeromexico Curbside, the International Ticketing/Check-In gate. If using an elevator, select Ticketing Level. When leaving the terminal, turn left and look for our vehicle near the orange traffic cone. The pickup location is marked with a “Municipal Transportation” sign. The pickup location for the North Terminal is still at Stall 1 of the Ground Transportation Center. The drop-off point for Ann Arbor is at the Blake Transit Center. 2.5 Stuff to Bring 2.5.1 For international students • Toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash (you can use it in the bathroom at the airport after you arrive in the United States. But please remember to check it in.) • Simple tableware (different from knives and forks, chopsticks and spoons can be carried with you without checking in), mainly used for temporary accommodation after arriving in the United States. • Summer clothes that are light • Necessary winter clothes, down jackets and jackets are available. Do not bring too thick sweaters and wool pants. Clothes such as sweaters can be brought. • Thermal underwear • It is recommended to bring more long and short socks. • Jeans can be worn in moderation. • Consider the United States before purchasing winter shoes. Snow in schools was not severe until mid-November. • Commonly used medicines can be brought, but they must be properly packaged individually. It would be better if there is a description of the content on the surface of the package for inspection by customs officers. • Electrical appliances: Since the voltage in the United States is 110V and the grounding hole of the socket is round, you need to check the compatibility of electrical appliances in other countries, and a transformer may be required, so it is not recommended to carry them. Electric appliances in the United States are relatively cheap, and have a wide coverage, and rice cookers will be sold, so don’t worry. Most of the supporting chargers for notebook computers can adapt to voltages in various regions of the world. • Accessories for electrical appliances: conversion plugs, sockets • Umbrellas and rain boots (there will still be a certain amount of precipitation in August and September). • Slippers (U.S. hotels generally do not provide disposable slippers) "],["academics.html", "Chapter 3 Academics 3.1 Introduction to Ross 3.2 Orientation 3.3 Navigating Canvas &amp; Wolverine Access 3.4 What to Expect from Summer Classes 3.5 Summer Career Opportunities 3.6 Business Attire: Professional vs. Casual", " Chapter 3 Academics 3.1 Introduction to Ross 3.2 Orientation 3.3 Navigating Canvas &amp; Wolverine Access 3.4 What to Expect from Summer Classes 3.5 Summer Career Opportunities 3.6 Business Attire: Professional vs. Casual "],["student-resources.html", "Chapter 4 Student Resources", " Chapter 4 Student Resources Gym Membership (free with tuition) Gain access the day your classes begin, membership is automatic, no sign up required Access to three different gyms on campus Central Campus Recreation Building (CCRB) Tennis and Basketball courts on Palmer Field (free) Intramural Sports Building (IMSB) North Campus Recreation Building (NCRB) Extra Items (for extra fee): Group‑X classes Intramural Sports Small Group Training classes Personal Training services. https://recsports.umich.edu/fitness/policies/ Printing Printing stations all across campus $43 worth of printing per semester Use MPrint to print at each location and find nearby printers https://mprint.umich.edu/ University Health Service Campus health and wellness resour*ce, offering comprehensive clinical services plus support for your well-being.
