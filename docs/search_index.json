It would be better if there is a description of the content on the surface of the package for inspection by customs officers.  Electrical appliances: Since the voltage in the United States is 110V and the grounding hole of the socket is round, you need to check the compatibility of electrical appliances in other countries, and a transformer may be required, so it is not recommended to carry them.

Most of the supporting chargers for notebook computers can adapt to voltages in various regions of the world.
