## Orientation

Orientation will take place some point in late June and will be an introduction to the Ross School of Business and the University of Michigan as a whole. It will be four days long and will consist of workshops, team bonding activities, and informational sessions.

You will be invited to join a canvas module and will receive most of your information from there. If you have any questions, you can ask your Student Success Adviser or email rossmban@umich.edu.

Some of the orientation will have you be mingled with the rest of the One Year Master's students and other parts of it will just be your cohort. 

There will be some prep work that you must do before orientation, so keep an eye out for some emails and updates on your canvas module.

Make sure to bring business casual clothes! There is a dress code for some of the days.
